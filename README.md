# Fine-Tuning and RNN Text Classification

This project is part of the **Applied Natural Language Processing (ANLP)** course.  
It demonstrates **fine-tuning and transfer learning** using FastAI’s `AWD_LSTM` model on the **IMDB movie reviews dataset**, followed by building an **RNN model for text classification**.  
Additionally, it includes an example of **text generation using GPT-2** from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

## Features
- Sampling IMDB dataset for faster experimentation  
- Fine-tuning a pre-trained **AWD_LSTM** language model  
- Transfer learning for **sentiment classification**  
- Generating text sequences using **GPT-2**  
- Implementing an **RNN** for custom text classification tasks

## Hello and Welcome

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page!  
I’m currently in the process of uploading my previous projects and doing my best to make them publicly available in an organized and clear manner.  

At the moment, I’m adding each project with some **light updates and clarifying adjustments**, and I plan to include more **comprehensive notes, explanations, and detailed READMEs** very soon — to help others better understand each project’s idea and usage.  

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would simply like to connect, I’d be delighted to hear from you:
